## 1. Project Description

Menu Maker automates family meal planning by letting users save their own recipes, store an ingredient dictionary, and instantly produce a seven-day meal plan (three meals per day). The system leverages artificial intelligence to scale ingredient quantities based on recipe calories, serving size, and each family memberâ€™s profile (age and gender). It outputs a single PDF that first lists the meal plan and then a consolidated, unit-converted shopping list.

## 2. Tech Stack

**Backend**

- PHP 8.2+
- Laravel 12.0+
- Inertia.js Laravel 2.0+
- MySQL
- Redis

**Frontend**

- Node.js 22
- Vue.js 3.4+
- Inertia.js Vue3 2.0+
- TailwindCSS 3.2.1+
- Shadcn-vue 2.2.0+

**Tooling & Testing**

- Vite 7
- Laravel Sail (Docker environment)

## 3. Getting Started Locally

### Prerequisites

- PHP 8.2+
- Composer
- Node.js 22 & npm
- Docker & Docker Compose (for Laravel Sail)

### Setup

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
$ git clone <repository-url>
$ cd menu-maker

# 2. Install PHP dependencies
$ composer install

# 3. Install JavaScript dependencies
$ npm ci

# 4. Configure environment
$ cp .env.example .env

# 5. Start the Docker environment via Sail (recommended)
$ ./vendor/bin/sail up -d

# 6. Generate application key (inside Sail)
$ ./vendor/bin/sail artisan key:generate

# 7. Run database migrations & seeders (inside Sail)
$ ./vendor/bin/sail artisan migrate --seed

# 8. Start development servers
$ npm run dev            # Vite dev server with HMR
# If needed, you can also start Laravel's server inside Sail:
$ ./vendor/bin/sail artisan serve
```

# Static analysis (Larastan)
./vendor/bin/sail composer phpstan
```

### Frontend (Vitest) & E2E (Playwright)

```bash
# Install dependencies (first time)
npm ci

# Install Playwright browsers/drivers (first time)
npx playwright install --with-deps

# Unit tests (Vue + Vitest)
npm run test:unit

# E2E tests (Playwright)
