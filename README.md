## 1. Project Description

Menu Maker automates family meal planning by letting users save their own recipes, store an ingredient dictionary, and instantly produce a seven-day meal plan (three meals per day). The system leverages artificial intelligence to scale ingredient quantities based on recipe calories, serving size, and each family memberâ€™s profile (age and gender). It outputs a single PDF that first lists the meal plan and then a consolidated, unit-converted shopping list.
